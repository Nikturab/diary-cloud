 - android client for schools' online diaries 

I wrote this application in 2017 year for Samsung IT School contest, in my school time..

The system, that many schools in Republic of Bashkortostan use, did not have an android client, that's why I made my own.

The app consists of two parts:
 - server-side, where parsing was being processed
 - client-side, an android app, that communicates with the server through the API
